# Human Activity Recognition using Smart Wearable Data

> Note: <br> *This is a project in progress and will be completed gradually. This README.md file was prepared using the information provided in the original [README.txt](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#) file. The main purpose of creating the present file is to provide a reader-friendlier document.* 

  
## Introduction

## Get To Know the Data
`subject` is an integer in $\[1, 30\]$. That is, the data were collected from $30$ subjects. 
 
`Activity` can take one of the following values: 
  + `STANDING`, 
  + `SITTING`, 
  + `LAYING`, 
  + `WALKING`, 
  + `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`,
  + `WALKING_UPSTAIRS`

### Training Set
`subject` values are 1,  3,  5,  6,  7,  8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30

### Test Set
`subject` values are 2,  4,  9, 10, 12, 13, 18, 20, 24
